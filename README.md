ZOVY:

Streaming Platform for 80's and 90's favorites.

I am excited about this project and to put this on my portfolio site & resume. A lot of my childhood revolved around older movies, tv shows and cartoons (especially being raised by my great-grandmother). In a way, revisiting the best parts of my childhood, is the best way to start a new journey. Using the old to shape my future is a hell of a way to start...


I am building the frontend using:
    
    HTML
    CSS
    Javascript/JSX
    React.js
      - React Hooks
      - React Router
    Bootstrap
   
I am building the backend using:

    Firebase
    
(it's overkill I know but I figured that if I want fullstack roles that I would make fullstack apps using relational databases w/ proper connectors.)
    
    
On the frontend users can sign up or sign in and the database will store their user credentials. They will be able to browse the various programs that are listed and view the trailers via a pop up YouTube video player. Users can filter through the titles to search for their desired program.

It's a really simple app.
