ZOVY:

Streaming platform for movies and tv-shows.

I am excited about this project and to put this on my portfolio site & resume. A lot of my childhood revolved around movies, tv shows and cartoons. In a way, revisiting the best parts of my childhood, is the best way to start a new journey. Using the old to shape my future is a hell of a way to start...


I am building this app using:
    
    HTML
    CSS
    Javascript
    React.js
      - React Hooks
      - React Router
    TMDB API
    Tailwind CSS
    Firebase
    Vercel
    
On the frontend users can sign up or sign in and the database will store their user credentials. They will be able to browse the various programs that are listed and view the "trailers" via a pop up YouTube video player.

It's a really simple app.
